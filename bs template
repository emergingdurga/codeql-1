Here’s an absolutely simple example to test repeating a Harness pipeline stage using Backstage Scaffolder + Handlebars — minimal and ready to try out.


---

✅ Goal: Repeat one stage per service in a single Harness pipeline YAML.


---

1. template.yaml

apiVersion: scaffolder.backstage.io/v1beta3
kind: Template
metadata:
  name: simple-harness-pipeline
  title: Simple Harness Pipeline
spec:
  parameters:
    - title: Services
      required: [services]
      properties:
        services:
          type: array
          items:
            type: object
            properties:
              name:
                type: string
  steps:
    - id: fetch
      name: Generate Pipeline
      action: fetch:template
      input:
        url: ./skeleton
        values:
          services: '{{ parameters.services }}'


---

2. skeleton/pipeline.yaml.hbs

pipeline:
  name: Simple Pipeline
  identifier: Simple_Pipeline
  projectIdentifier: MyProject
  orgIdentifier: default
  stages:
    {{#each services}}
    - stage:
        name: {{name}} Stage
        identifier: {{name}}_Stage
        type: Custom
        spec:
          execution:
            steps:
              - step:
                  type: ShellScript
                  name: Echo {{name}}
                  identifier: echo_{{name}}
                  spec:
                    shell: Bash
                    command: echo "Running stage for {{name}}"
    {{/each}}


---

3. User input during scaffolding

services:
  - name: auth
  - name: payment


---

✅ Final Output (pipeline.yaml)

pipeline:
  name: Simple Pipeline
  identifier: Simple_Pipeline
  projectIdentifier: MyProject
  orgIdentifier: default
  stages:
    - stage:
        name: auth Stage
        identifier: auth_Stage
        type: Custom
        spec:
          execution:
            steps:
              - step:
                  type: ShellScript
                  name: Echo auth
                  identifier: echo_auth
                  spec:
                    shell: Bash
                    command: echo "Running stage for auth"
    - stage:
        name: payment Stage
        identifier: payment_Stage
        type: Custom
        spec:
          execution:
            steps:
              - step:
                  type: ShellScript
                  name: Echo payment
                  identifier: echo_payment
                  spec:
                    shell: Bash
                    command: echo "Running stage for payment"

This is the bare minimum version to prove that repetition works. Just drop this in a new Backstage template and test.

Would you like this to also generate a file per service, or integrate with a real Harness project next?
