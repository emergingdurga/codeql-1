To install Maven on a Mac using the tar.gz file, follow these steps:

1. Download the Maven tar.gz File:

Visit the Maven download page.

Download the latest tar.gz file.



2. Extract the tar.gz File:

Open Terminal.

Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the tar.gz file.

Run the following command to extract it:

tar -xzf apache-maven-*.tar.gz

This will create a folder like apache-maven-x.x.x (replace x.x.x with the actual version).



3. Move the Extracted Directory (Optional):

Move the extracted folder to a location where you want to keep Maven, such as /opt.

sudo mv apache-maven-* /opt/maven



4. Set up Environment Variables:

Open or create the ~/.zshrc file if you're using Zsh (the default shell on macOS), or ~/.bash_profile if using Bash.

Add the following lines to set Maven environment variables:

export M2_HOME=/opt/maven
export PATH=$M2_HOME/bin:$PATH

Save and close the file.



5. Apply the Changes:

Source the profile to apply the changes:

source ~/.zshrc  # For Zsh

or

source ~/.bash_profile  # For Bash



6. Verify the Installation:

Run the following command to confirm Maven is installed:

mvn -v




You should now see Maven's version information, which confirms it is successfully installed.
